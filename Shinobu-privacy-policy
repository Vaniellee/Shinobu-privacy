Shinobu does not store any data by default. A server member with Server Management permission can use the prefix to change the bot's prefix October
if he uses the command, the server's automatically generated Discord ID (for example, 936977814421405727) will be sent to the bot with the prefix provided
it will be stored in the database.These are valid within the adjustable commands.The reason for this data storage is that when the bot is turned off and turned on, the bot has no problems
it's to keep him going.
No other data about the server is stored. Shinobu never stores user-specific data. Prefix data is stored only for the operation of the bot, and
it is not shared with anyone else or used for any other reason. The data is stored on paid Virtual Private Servers.
You can also contact me at MÃ¢rius#2998 (1030495490963411045) discord to request deletion of the data or to the support server
you can come and open a request and specify this.
The data is stored for less than 30 days. The data is protected on a private virtual server.
